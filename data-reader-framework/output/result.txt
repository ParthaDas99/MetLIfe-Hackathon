Test Plan
1 Introduction
The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach. This document will 
clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.
1.1 Objectives
The main objective of testing is to: assure that the system meets the full requirements, including quality requirements (functional and non-functional requirements) and fit 
metrics for each quality requirement and satisfies the use case scenarios and maintain the quality of the product. At the end of the project development cycle, the user 
should find that the project has met or exceeded all of their expectations as detailed in the requirements.
Any changes, additions, or deletions to the requirements document, Functional Specification, or Design Specification will be documented and tested at the highest level of 
quality allowed within the remaining time of the project and within the ability of the test team.
The secondary objectives of testing will be to: identify all issues and associated risks, communicate all known issues to the project team, and ensure that all issues are 
addressed in an appropriately before release. 
1.2 Team Members
Role Responsibilities Staff Member

5. Defect reporting and tracking
6. Defects rechecking and regression testing
7. Preparation of Test Data
8. Coordinate with QA Lead for any issues or problems 
encountered during test preparation/execution/defect 
handling.
2 Scope
2.1 In Scope
The <system name> Test Plan defines the unit, integration, system, regression, and Client Acceptance testing approach.  
The test scope includes the following:
    • Testing of all functional, application performance, security and use cases requirements listed in the Use Case document.
    • Quality requirements and fit metrics <system name>.
    • End-to-end testing and testing of interfaces of all systems that interact with the <system name>.
2.1 Out of Scope
The following are considered out of scope for the Test Plan of the <system name> system and testing scope:
    • Functional requirements testing for systems outside <application name>                                        
    • Testing of Business SOPs, disaster recovery and Business Continuity Plan.
3 Assumptions / Risks
3.1 Assumptions
This section lists assumptions that are made specific to this project:
    • Business analyst and development team members will be available to provide support, training and defect resolution to the test team members 
as required.
3.2 Risks
The following risks have been identified and the appropriate action identified to mitigate their impact on the project. The impact (or severity) of the risk is based on how the 
project would be affected if the risk was triggered. The trigger is the event, which would cause the risk to become an issue to be dealt with.
# Risk Severity Trigger Mitigation Plan
1 Scope Creep – as testers become more 
familiar with the tool, they will want more 
functionality
High Delays in implementation date Each iteration, functionality will be closely 
monitored. Priorities will be set and discussed by 
stakeholders.  All additional out of scope activities 
will be documented.
2 Changes to the functionality may require 
additional time because the already written 
test cases may become irrelevant
Medium Big changes in the 
requirements
To estimate additional functionality separately and 
add it to the Test Plan with all artifacts (additional 
resources should be needed).
3 Weekly delivery is not possible because the 
developer/QA engireer should urgently 
work on another project or got sick.
Medium Product did not get delivered 
on schedule
Replacement of the team members should be 
included in the plan before the project starts or 
immediately after its launch.
4 Test Approach
The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team and will be 
tested.The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team and 
will be tested.
Test cases will be created during exploratory testing.
Team also must use experience-based testing and error guessing using skills and intuition, along with the experience with similar applications or technologies.
4.1 Test Automation
Automated unit tests are part of the development process, but no automated functional tests are planned at this time.
5 Test Environment
As testing Environment, it was decided to test the Application on:
    • Google Pixel (Android 9)
    • Samsung Galaxy S8 (Android 8)
    • iPad Air (iOS 11.3.1)
    • iPhone X (iOS 12.0.1)
    • Windows 10 / Chrome 71
    • Windows 10 / Firefox 64
    • MacOS 10.13 / Safari 11.1.2
as far as these combinations are the representatives of Android and iOS versions with different screen resolutions and most popular desktop 
browsers.
The special test tools that are required:
    • Charles
    • Fake location tool
Other testing needs:
    • Bluetooth headset

7 TEST STRATEGY
7.1 QA role in test process
- Understanding Requirements:
• Requirement specifications will be sent by client.
• Understanding of requirements will be done by QA.
- Preparing Test Cases:
QA will be preparing test cases based on the exploratory testing. This will cover all scenarios for requirements.
- Preparing Test Matrix:
QA will be preparing test matrix which maps test cases to respective requirement. This will ensure the coverage for requirements.
- Reviewing test cases and matrix:
• Peer review will be conducted for test cases and test matrix by QA Lead.
• Any comments or suggestions on test cases and test coverage will be provided by reviewer.
• Suggestions or improvements will be re-worked by author and will be send for approval.
• Re-worked improvements will be reviewed and approved by reviewer.
- Creating Test Data:
Test data will be created by respective QA on client's developments/test site based on scenarios and Test cases.
- Executing Test Cases:
• Test cases will be executed by respective QA on client's development/test site based on designed scenarios, test cases and test data.
• Test result (Actual Result, Pass/Fail/Pass but/Blocked) will updated in test case document: QA will be logging the defect/bugs to the Bug tracking system. After this, QA 
will inform respective developer about the defect/bugs.
- Retesting and Regression Testing:
Retesting for fixed bugs will be done by respective QA once it is resolved by respective developer and bug/defect status will be updated accordingly. The regression testing 
will be done after the bug recheck.
7.2 Testing types
Functional Testing:
Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with functional requirements.
GUI Testing:
GUI testing will includes testing the UI part of the system. It covers layout, error messages, spelling mistakes, GUI guideline violations.
Regression testing:
Testing of a previously tested component or system following modification to ensure that defects have not been introduced or have been uncovered in unchanged areas of 
the software, as a result of the changes made.
Usability testing:
Testing to evaluate the degree to which the system can be used by specified users with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
7.3 Bug Severity Definition
The bug Severity levels will be defined as outlined in the following table below. Testing will assign a severity level to all bugs. The Test Lead will be responsible to see 
that a correct severity level is assigned to each bug.
The QA Lead and Project Manager will participate in bug review meetings to assign the priority of all currently active bugs.
Severity ID Severity Severity description
1 Blocker
This defect blocks a feature and doesn't allow to test/check 
functionality
2 Critical
It is a highly severe defect and collapses the system. 
However, certain parts of the system remain functional.
3 Major
The failed function is unusable but there exists an 
acceptable alternative method to achieve the required 
results
4 Minor
The defect that does not result in the termination and does 
not damage the usability of the system
5 Low
It won't cause any major break-down of the system, 
mainly cosmetic issue

Test Plan
1 Introduction
The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach. This document will
clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.
1.1 Objectives
The main objective of testing is to: assure that the system meets the full requirements, including quality requirements (functional and non-functional requirements) and fit
metrics for each quality requirement and satisfies the use case scenarios and maintain the quality of the product. At the end of the project development cycle, the user
should find that the project has met or exceeded all of their expectations as detailed in the requirements.
Any changes, additions, or deletions to the requirements document, Functional Specification, or Design Specification will be documented and tested at the highest level of
quality allowed within the remaining time of the project and within the ability of the test team.
The secondary objectives of testing will be to: identify all issues and associated risks, communicate all known issues to the project team, and ensure that all issues are
addressed in an appropriately before release.

2 Scope
2.1 In Scope
The <system name> Test Plan defines the unit, integration, system, regression, and Client Acceptance testing approach.
The test scope includes the following:
• Testing of all functional, application performance, security and use cases requirements listed in the Use Case document.
• Quality requirements and fit metrics <system name>.
• End-to-end testing and testing of interfaces of all systems that interact with the <system name>.
2.1 Out of Scope
The following are considered out of scope for the Test Plan of the <system name> system and testing scope:
• Functional requirements testing for systems outside <application name>
• Testing of Business SOPs, disaster recovery and Business Continuity Plan.
3 Assumptions / Risks
3.1 Assumptions
This section lists assumptions that are made specific to this project:
• Business analyst and development team members will be available to provide support, training and defect resolution to the test team members
as required.
3.2 Risks
The following risks have been identified and the appropriate action identified to mitigate their impact on the project. The impact (or severity) of the risk is based on how the
project would be affected if the risk was triggered. The trigger is the event, which would cause the risk to become an issue to be dealt with.
# Risk Severity Trigger Mitigation Plan
1 Scope Creep – as testers become more
familiar with the tool, they will want more
functionality
High Delays in implementation date Each iteration, functionality will be closely
monitored. Priorities will be set and discussed by
stakeholders.  All additional out of scope activities
will be documented.
2 Changes to the functionality may require
additional time because the already written
test cases may become irrelevant
Medium Big changes in the
requirements
To estimate additional functionality separately and
add it to the Test Plan with all artifacts (additional
resources should be needed).
3 Weekly delivery is not possible because the
developer/QA engireer should urgently
work on another project or got sick.
Medium Product did not get delivered
on schedule
Replacement of the team members should be
included in the plan before the project starts or
immediately after its launch.
4 Test Approach
The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team and will be
tested.The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team and
will be tested.
Test cases will be created during exploratory testing.
Team also must use experience-based testing and error guessing using skills and intuition, along with the experience with similar applications or technologies.
4.1 Test Automation
Automated unit tests are part of the development process, but no automated functional tests are planned at this time.
5 Test Environment
As testing Environment, it was decided to test the Application on:
• Google Pixel (Android 9)
• Samsung Galaxy S8 (Android 8)
• iPad Air (iOS 11.3.1)
• iPhone X (iOS 12.0.1)
• Windows 10 / Chrome 71
• Windows 10 / Firefox 64
• MacOS 10.13 / Safari 11.1.2
as far as these combinations are the representatives of Android and iOS versions with different screen resolutions and most popular desktop
browsers.
The special test tools that are required:
• Charles
• Fake location tool
Other testing needs:
• Bluetooth headset

7 TEST STRATEGY
7.1 QA role in test process
- Understanding Requirements:
• Requirement specifications will be sent by client.
• Understanding of requirements will be done by QA.
- Preparing Test Cases:
QA will be preparing test cases based on the exploratory testing. This will cover all scenarios for requirements.
- Preparing Test Matrix:
QA will be preparing test matrix which maps test cases to respective requirement. This will ensure the coverage for requirements.
- Reviewing test cases and matrix:
• Peer review will be conducted for test cases and test matrix by QA Lead.
• Any comments or suggestions on test cases and test coverage will be provided by reviewer.
• Suggestions or improvements will be re-worked by author and will be send for approval.
• Re-worked improvements will be reviewed and approved by reviewer.
- Creating Test Data:
Test data will be created by respective QA on client's developments/test site based on scenarios and Test cases.
- Executing Test Cases:
• Test cases will be executed by respective QA on client's development/test site based on designed scenarios, test cases and test data.
• Test result (Actual Result, Pass/Fail/Pass but/Blocked) will updated in test case document: QA will be logging the defect/bugs to the Bug tracking system. After this, QA
✅ Status: Blocked
will inform respective developer about the defect/bugs.
- Retesting and Regression Testing:
Retesting for fixed bugs will be done by respective QA once it is resolved by respective developer and bug/defect status will be updated accordingly. The regression testing
will be done after the bug recheck.
7.2 Testing types
Functional Testing:
Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with functional requirements.
GUI Testing:
GUI testing will includes testing the UI part of the system. It covers layout, error messages, spelling mistakes, GUI guideline violations.
Regression testing:
Testing of a previously tested component or system following modification to ensure that defects have not been introduced or have been uncovered in unchanged areas of
the software, as a result of the changes made.
Usability testing:
Testing to evaluate the degree to which the system can be used by specified users with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
7.3 Bug Severity Definition
The bug Severity levels will be defined as outlined in the following table below. Testing will assign a severity level to all bugs. The Test Lead will be responsible to see
that a correct severity level is assigned to each bug.
The QA Lead and Project Manager will participate in bug review meetings to assign the priority of all currently active bugs.
Severity ID Severity Severity description
1 Blocker
This defect blocks a feature and doesn't allow to test/check
functionality
2 Critical
It is a highly severe defect and collapses the system.
However, certain parts of the system remain functional.
3 Major
The failed function is unusable but there exists an
acceptable alternative method to achieve the required
results
4 Minor
The defect that does not result in the termination and does
not damage the usability of the system
5 Low
It won't cause any major break-down of the system,
mainly cosmetic issue
